STOP_UPDATE_REASON: Final = """Before stopping, decide whether this turn produced LLM Wiki–worthy
knowledge, then act on that decision. Do not write reflexively — judge first.

Step 1 — Judge. This turn is worth recording ONLY if it produced at least one of:
- a durable fact, decision, or the rationale behind it that outlives this conversation;
- a reusable procedure, gotcha, convention, or constraint someone would want again later;
- a relationship between entities/concepts the wiki does not already capture;
- an open question worth tracking.
It is NOT worth recording when the turn was transient: a one-off question, exploration with no
conclusion, a trivial change already self-explanatory in code/git, or knowledge the wiki already
holds. When in doubt, prefer NOT writing — low-signal notes are worse than none.

Step 2 — If nothing qualifies: stop normally without writing, and say in one line that you
judged this turn as not wiki-worthy.

Step 3 — If something qualifies, use the configured llm-wiki MCP server to:
1. search `SCHEMA.md`, `index.md`, recent `log.md`, and any affected entity/concept pages first;
2. write only the durable knowledge identified in Step 1 (summarize — never copy private
   transcripts wholesale);
3. update `index.md` and append a compact `log.md` entry for any durable wiki change;
4. use returned `content_hash` values as `if_hash` when updating existing notes.
Then stop normally.
